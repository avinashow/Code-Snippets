            The time zone name must be specified appropriately, using the standard
            UNIX time zone naming conventions.  The name is of the form "XXXxYYY",
            where XXX is the abbreviation for the standard time zone, x is the
            offset of that timezone from GMT in hours, and YYY is the abbreviation
            for the daylight savings time zone.  For example, EST5EDT is the Eastern
            U.S. time zone and MST7MDT is the Mountain U.S. time zone.
            <para>
            The system does recognize the names "EASTERN" (synonymous with EST5EDT),
            "CENTRAL" (CST6CDT), "MOUNTAIN" (MST7MDT), and "PACIFIC" (PST8PDT).
